# I-See-Digits
This is a fairly simple project of Machine Learning which allows the user to enter a number 'X' and a picture(of 28 * 28 pixels) which contains a digit[from 0 to 9] and then and tells the user whether the picture is 'X' or not. The most basic project you will ever see!!

## How to use?
Fork the repository - run "Identifying_Digit.py" and that's basically it. 
The training and test dataset are fairly large, so try taking a fraction of them if memory error occurs 

## Packages used
* For collection of data: pandas, and
* for the data analysis part: sklearn, numpy and matplotlib used

## Concepts used
Concepts of Data Science and Machine Learning like Data Wrangling, cross value prediction, K-Neighbors Classifier, confusion matrix, Precision-Recall Curve, f1_score and some others used.

## Current Status
All Done!!
